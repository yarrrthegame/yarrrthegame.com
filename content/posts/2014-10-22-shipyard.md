The first serious feature request arrived last week after publishing lua ship creation.  Fellow ship
designers wanted to test their ships on their local machine before sending me the pull request.  Since
this was my first feature request I threw everything in the corner and started to work on it immediately.

Today I would like to proudly present the *shipyard*.  It will be installed automatically with the yarrr
package just update it.  However there are some additional steps to be completed before launching it.

## Download public configuration

Fork the public config repository on github and clone it.

~~~ bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your user>/publicconfig.git
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
~~~

Don't forget to update submodules after updating your working copy.

## Start shipyard

Remember to pass the path to the folder containing config.lua as config-path.

~~~ bash
$ yarrrshipyard --config-path <path to public config>
~~~

## Try your ship

Just type /ship yourshiptype in the terminal. Meanwhile have one eye on the terminal since lua runtime
errors are logged to it.

Have fun!
