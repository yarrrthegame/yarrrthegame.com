After almost one month of hard work finally I have published the first version of the mission system.
I have implemented the most dummy tutorial mission ever made as well.  Update your client and it should
give you the necessary instructions to start it.

As with objects, missions are part of the public configuration.  You can play around with them
using *yarrrshipyard* and send a pull request.

I would really appreciate hearing your thoughts about it.
