To be honest thruster was added yesterday, but I was too tired to write about it. So what
about it? Next to your canons you are going to see your thrusters as well. It behaves just like any
other item: if someone shoots you down it is going to be dropped as loot just like your canons. The
funny thing is that when you pick it up, it gets mounted automatically. Are you pro enough to drive
a ship with unbalanced thrusters?
