I was delaying this task for a while, but yesterday the tcp stream started to fall apart for some
reason, so I decided to cut a bit on the traffic. I managed to decrease it with a significant 90%
without any bit magic, though I modified the refresh frequency on the server. Please let me know if
you don't like it.
